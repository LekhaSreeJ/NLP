This project aims to classify diseases using the PTB-XL dataset. The PTB-XL dataset is a large-scale electrocardiography (ECG) dataset consisting of 218,000 ECG recordings from 85,000 patients. 
In this project, we will use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to classify diseases based on the ECG recordings.
